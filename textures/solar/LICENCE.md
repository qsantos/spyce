Copyright Information
=====================

All textures and images on this site are Copyright (c) by James Hastings-Trew.
The maps are free to download and use as source material or resource in artwork
or rendering (CGI or real time) in any kind of project - personal, commercial,
broadcast, or display. You are not free to redistribute the maps "as is" in any
medium - online, CD, for sale, etc. where the primary intent is to distribute
the maps themselves and not the result of using the maps, without my
permission. That is to say, the results of using the maps are free to use and
distribute, but the maps as direct source material for those results may not
be, unless you have my permission. The maps may not be included as they exist
on this site in any kind of commercial, shareware, or freeware product without
my permission. The maps may not be repackaged with 3D models and sold in any
form. The maps may not be given away in whole or in part on another website or
in a freeware or commercial product without my permission.

Here are some examples of usage that I hope will clear the situation up:


Example 1 - The Simulator or Game
---------------------------------

You are a software author who has created a Solar System simulator and you want
to use my planet texture maps in your program. Since the primary intent of your
use is to create real time renderings utilizing the planet texture maps as a
resource in your software product, this is an acceptable use under my copyright
terms.


Example 2 - The Fantasy Poster
------------------------------

You are an artist who is producting a poster for sale on the internet and you
wish to use one of my planet texture maps as source material in your artwork.
Since the primary intent of your use is to create artwork using the planet
texture maps as a resource in your artwork, this is an acceptable use under my
copyright terms.


Example 3 - The Japanese Space Museum
-------------------------------------

You are the curator of a Japanese Space Museum and you wish to use my planet
texture maps in an animated display showing the motions of the solar system.
Since the primary intent of your use is to create artwork (the animation) using
the planet texture maps as resources, this is an acceptable use under my
copyright terms.


Example 4 - The 3D Rendering Program
------------------------------------

You are a software author and you wish to include the planet texture maps from
my site with your product as part of the content set you are offering with your
program (commercial, shareware, or freeware). Since you want to distribute the
maps, and not the results of using the maps, you will need my permission to do
so.


Example 5 - The Quick Buck Artist
---------------------------------

You are looking to make some money off of my work, and you decide to package up
some sphere models made in 3D Studio Max with my maps wrapped around them, and
sell them on a website for a significant amount of money. Since you want to
distribute the maps, and not the results of using the maps, you will need my
persmission to do so. Except I will not give you permission to directly sell
what I am giving away for free here — that would be unethical and a blot on
your karma. Shame on you. Go tell your mom what you have done. She'll know what
to do with you.
